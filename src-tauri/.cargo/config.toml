# Speed up development builds
#
# Dependencies (aubio, symphonia, sqlite, etc.) are compiled with opt-level 1
# even in debug mode. This makes the FIRST build slightly slower, but:
# 1. The app runs faster (important for audio decoding / BPM analysis)
# 2. Subsequent incremental builds only recompile YOUR code (fast)
#
# Your own code (recodeck crate) still compiles in debug mode for fast iteration.
