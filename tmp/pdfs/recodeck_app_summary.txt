RecoDeck - One-Page App Summary
(Based only on repository evidence)

WHAT IT IS
RecoDeck is a desktop music library app built with Tauri, React, TypeScript,
and Rust. It scans local audio folders, stores metadata in SQLite, supports
playback, analyzes BPM/key, and adds AI-assisted chat/playlist generation.

WHO IT IS FOR
Primary persona (inferred from code and naming): digital DJs managing large
local music libraries and playlist prep workflows.
Explicit persona statement in docs: Not found in repo.

WHAT IT DOES
- Scans library folders recursively and imports supported audio files
  (mp3, flac, wav, aiff/aif, m4a, ogg) with tag metadata and file hashes.
- Maintains track library data in SQLite (tracks, analysis, playlists,
  settings, genres) with migrations and indexed queries.
- Provides folder-tree and playlist organization, including playlist folders,
  add/remove tracks, rename/delete, and track counts.
- Plays audio with queue, next/previous, seek, repeat/shuffle, volume,
  and crossfade support, plus native decode fallback for unsupported formats.
- Analyzes tracks for BPM and musical key (Camelot/Open Key), stores results,
  and shows analysis progress for single-track, folder, or full-library runs.
- Watches library folders for file changes and emits "library-changed" events
  so the UI can re-scan and refresh automatically.
- Includes AI chat and AI playlist generation (Claude API key in settings),
  with cached library context rebuilt after library/analysis updates.

HOW IT WORKS (COMPACT ARCHITECTURE)
Components/services:
- Frontend: React app (`src/App.tsx`) + UI components + Zustand stores.
- Bridge: `src/lib/tauri-api.ts` calls Rust commands via Tauri `invoke`.
- Backend: Rust command modules (`src-tauri/src/commands/*`) for library,
  scanner, analysis, playback, playlists, genres, settings, watcher, and AI.
- Data layer: SQLite via rusqlite (`src-tauri/src/db/*`), DB file initialized
  at app data path as `recodeck.db`.
Data flow:
- User action in UI -> Tauri command -> Rust service -> SQLite/file system.
- Rust emits events (`library-changed`, `audio-chunk`, `audio-ended`,
  `audio-error`) -> frontend listeners/stores -> UI updates.

HOW TO RUN (MINIMAL GETTING STARTED)
1. Install JavaScript dependencies:
   npm install
2. Start the desktop app in development mode:
   npm run tauri dev
3. In the app UI, click "Scan Folder" (or add folders in Settings) to import
   your local music library.
