## Notes & Deviations

### Audio Playback Architecture Change
The original plan called for a premium PCM streaming architecture (Symphonia decoder → Tauri IPC events → Web Audio API). This was implemented but found to be non-functional in practice:
1. **JSON serialization of audio samples** — `Vec<f32>` serialized as JSON arrays is extremely slow for real-time audio
2. **Tauri v2 asset protocol** — Has known issues (403 Forbidden errors) making it unreliable
3. **Solution** — Custom `stream://` URI scheme protocol + standard HTML5 Audio. The Rust backend serves audio files directly via `register_uri_scheme_protocol`, and the frontend plays them with a normal `<audio>` element. Much simpler, much more reliable.

The Symphonia decoder and playback commands remain in the codebase for future use (waveform generation, audio analysis, etc.) but are no longer used for basic playback.

---

### 2026-02-05 - Phase 2 Start: Milestone 2.2 — BPM Detection

**Dependency:**
- Added `bliss-audio-aubio-rs` 0.2 with `builtin` + `bindgen` features
  - Compiles aubio C library from source (no system dependency required)
  - Uses `bindgen` to generate FFI bindings for Apple Silicon (no prebuilt bindings)

**Audio Decoder Enhancement (src-tauri/src/audio/decoder.rs):**
- ✅ New `MonoAudio` struct: holds decoded mono samples, sample rate, and duration
- ✅ New `decode_to_mono()` function: decodes entire audio file to mono f32 PCM
  - Reusable foundation for ALL DSP analysis (BPM, key, waveform, spectrogram, etc.)
  - Handles all supported formats (MP3, FLAC, WAV, AIFF)
  - Gracefully skips corrupted packets
  - Channel mixing: averages all channels to produce mono output
- ✅ Helper functions: `convert_to_mono_f32`, `mix_to_mono_f32`, `mix_to_mono_generic`

**BPM Detection Module (src-tauri/src/audio/bpm.rs):**
- ✅ `detect_bpm(path)` — main API: takes file path, returns BPM + confidence
- ✅ `detect_bpm_from_samples(audio)` — internal: works on pre-decoded audio (testable)
- ✅ Uses aubio `Tempo` tracker with `SpecFlux` onset mode
  - Buffer size: 1024, Hop size: 512 (50% overlap)
  - Processes audio in overlapping frames for accurate beat tracking
- ✅ Reasonable range check: rejects BPM < 40 or > 300
- ✅ 8 unit tests with synthetic click tracks:
  - 120 BPM, 128 BPM, 140 BPM detection (±2-3 BPM tolerance)
  - Empty audio, silence, short audio, different sample rates (48kHz)
  - All pass successfully

**Database Layer (src-tauri/src/db/mod.rs):**
- ✅ New `TrackAnalysis` struct — represents DSP analysis record
- ✅ `save_bpm_analysis(track_id, bpm, confidence)` — upsert into track_analysis table
- ✅ `get_bpm_analysis(track_id)` — returns (bpm, confidence) or None
- ✅ `get_track_analysis(track_id)` — returns full analysis record
- ✅ `has_bpm_analysis(track_id)` — checks if BPM exists
- ✅ 5 new DB tests: save/get, not-analyzed, upsert, has_bpm, full analysis

**Tauri Commands (src-tauri/src/commands/analysis.rs):**
- ✅ `analyze_bpm` — analyze single track: fetch path → detect BPM → store → return
- ✅ `analyze_all_bpm` — batch: finds unanalyzed tracks, processes all, skips errors
- ✅ `get_track_analysis` — retrieve analysis data for any track
- ✅ DTOs: `BpmResultDTO`, `TrackAnalysisDTO` for frontend serialization
- ✅ All 3 commands registered in lib.rs invoke handler

**Test Results: 42/42 passing** (8 DB original + 7 scanner + 7 search + 6 settings + 1 audio decoder + 5 DB analysis + 8 BPM tests)

---

### Database Persistence Change
The app previously used an in-memory database (`:memory:`) which lost all data on each restart. Milestone 1.8 switched to a persistent file-based database stored in the OS app data directory (`appDataDir()`). The `init_database` command now creates parent directories if needed. On startup, the app loads the saved theme and re-scans all saved library folders to detect any new files.

---

### 2026-02-06 - Folder Tree Panel (Traktor-style sidebar)

**Backend (Rust):**
- ✅ New DB method: `count_tracks_in_folder(folder_path)` — SQL LIKE query for track count by path prefix

- ✅ Explorer shows Home (🏠) as root with all user directories (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, etc.)
- ✅ All folders expand/collapse with lazy-loaded subdirectories from filesystem
- ✅ **Auto-scan on click**: clicking any folder in Explorer auto-scans it (imports new audio files, skips existing ones), then shows tracks — no manual "Scan Folder" needed
- ✅ Right-click context menu differs by section:
  - Library folders: "Analyze Tracks"
  - Explorer folders: "Analyze Tracks" + "Add to Library" (scans + persists in settings)
- ✅ Section headers are collapsible (click to hide/show entire section)
- ✅ Scanning banner ("Scanning folder...") shows during Explorer auto-scan
- ✅ `homeDir()` from `@tauri-apps/api/path` to get user's home directory
- ✅ `core:path:default` permission added to capabilities
- ✅ Rust cargo check passes, TypeScript compiles clean, no linter errors

**Playlists System + Explorer Removal:**
- ✅ Removed Explorer/Home filesystem browser (not appropriate for a music library app)
- ✅ **Migration 002**: `ALTER TABLE playlists ADD COLUMN parent_id` for folder hierarchy
- ✅ Migration runner updated to run 002 idempotently (ignores if column exists)
- ✅ **Playlist DB methods**: create_playlist, get_all_playlists, get_playlist, rename_playlist, delete_playlist (recursive for folders), get_playlist_tracks (with analysis JOIN), add_track_to_playlist, remove_track_from_playlist, count_playlist_tracks

  - PlaylistDTO with track_count field
  - All 8 commands registered in lib.rs
- ✅ **Frontend Playlist type** + 8 API wrappers in tauri-api.ts
- ✅ **FolderTree rewritten** with two sections (like Traktor):
  - **Track Collection** (💿): Library folders with subfolders + track counts
  - **Playlists** (🎶): User-created playlists and folders
- ✅ **Right-click context menus**:
  - Playlists header: Create Playlist, Create Folder
  - Playlist folder: Create Playlist, Create Folder, Rename, Delete
  - Playlist item: Rename, Delete

### 2026-02-06 - Phase 2: Milestone 2.3 — Key Detection

**Dependency:**
- Added `rustfft` 6.2 crate for FFT computation (chromagram generation)

**Key Detection Module (src-tauri/src/audio/key.rs):**
- ✅ `detect_key(path)` — main API: takes file path, returns Camelot key + musical key + confidence
- ✅ `detect_key_from_samples(audio)` — internal: works on pre-decoded audio (testable)
- ✅ Chromagram computation via FFT:
  - FFT size: 4096, Hop size: 2048 (50% overlap)
  - Hanning window for spectral leakage reduction
  - Maps FFT bins to 12 pitch classes (C through B) in range 65Hz–2000Hz
  - Uses 12-TET tuning with A=440Hz reference
  - Power accumulation (magnitude squared) across all frames
  - Normalized to sum to 1.0 for scale-independence
- ✅ Krumhansl-Schmuckler profile matching:
  - Pearson correlation against all 24 key profiles (12 major + 12 minor)
  - Profile rotation to test all root notes
  - Best match selected from highest correlation
- ✅ Camelot wheel notation (primary display — DJ standard):
  - Full 24-key mapping: 1A-12A (minor), 1B-12B (major)
  - Musical notation as secondary (Am, C, F#m, etc.)
- ✅ Confidence scoring:
  - Based on gap between best and second-best correlations (70%)
  - Plus absolute correlation strength (30%)
  - Clamped to [0.0, 1.0] range
- ✅ 12 unit tests with synthetic signals:
  - A440 pure tone, C major chord, A minor chord, D minor chord
  - Empty audio, too-short audio, silence
  - Camelot format validation, confidence range check
  - Different sample rate (48kHz), musical key names validation
  - Camelot table completeness (24 unique codes)

**Database Layer (src-tauri/src/db/mod.rs):**
- ✅ `save_key_analysis(track_id, musical_key, key_confidence)` — upsert into track_analysis table
- ✅ `get_key_analysis(track_id)` — returns (key, confidence) or None
- ✅ `has_key_analysis(track_id)` — checks if key exists
- ✅ Incremental analysis: saving key does NOT overwrite BPM (and vice versa)
- ✅ Extended `get_all_tracks_with_analysis()` to include musical_key + key_confidence
- ✅ Extended `get_tracks_in_folder_with_analysis()` to include key data
- ✅ 8 new DB tests (key save/get, upsert, has_key, preserves_bpm, preserves_key, includes_key_in_join)

**Tauri Commands (src-tauri/src/commands/analysis.rs):**
- ✅ `analyze_key` — analyze single track: decode → chromagram → K-S match → store Camelot key
- ✅ `analyze_all_keys` — batch: finds unanalyzed tracks, processes all, skips errors
- ✅ `KeyResultDTO` with track_id, camelot, musical_key, confidence
- ✅ Both commands registered in lib.rs invoke handler

**TrackDTO & Frontend Types Updated:**
- ✅ `TrackDTO` (Rust) extended with `musical_key: Option<String>` and `key_confidence: Option<f64>`
- ✅ `Track` (TypeScript) extended with `musical_key?: string` and `key_confidence?: number`
- ✅ `KeyResult` TypeScript interface added
- ✅ `tauriApi.analyzeKey()` and `tauriApi.analyzeAllKeys()` API wrappers added
- ✅ `get_all_tracks` and `get_tracks_in_folder` now return key data in LEFT JOIN

**Test Results: 61/61 passing** (8 DB original + 7 scanner + 7 search + 6 settings + 1 audio decoder + 5 DB BPM analysis + 8 BPM tests + 8 DB key analysis + 12 key tests — note: some counts overlap)

---

---

### 2026-02-09 — BPM/Key UI and analysis triggers

**Track table:**
- Key column now shows detected Camelot key (`musical_key`) instead of "—"; tooltip shows confidence %
- Key column sort fixed: sorts by `musical_key` (was placeholder empty sort)
- Right-click context menu on a track row: "Analyze BPM & Key" — runs BPM + Key analysis for that track, then refreshes list

**Folder "Analyze Tracks":**
- Now runs both BPM and Key analysis (previously only BPM)
- Skips tracks that already have BPM/Key; reports how many BPM vs Key analyses were done

**Next:** Phase 2 — 2.1 Mel spectrogram or 2.4 Waveform peaks; or more Phase 2 AI/UI milestones.

---

### 2026-02-09 — BPM alignment with Traktor

**Problem:** BPM in RecoDeck did not match the same tracks when checked in Traktor (different algorithm, half/double tempo ambiguity).

**Fixes:**

1. **Read BPM from file tags on scan**
   - Scanner now reads BPM from ID3 TBPM / tag (ItemKey::Bpm, IntegerBpm) via lofty.
   - When a file already has BPM in tags (e.g. written by Traktor or Rekordbox), it is saved to `track_analysis` with confidence 0.99 on import.
   - So: if you analyze in Traktor first, then add the folder in RecoDeck, RecoDeck will show the same BPM.

2. **Tempo normalization for aubio detection**
   - In `src-tauri/src/audio/bpm.rs`, after aubio returns BPM we normalize to "DJ range" (80–200 BPM):
     - If 40–79 BPM → double (e.g. 64 → 128) to avoid half-tempo lock.
     - If 200–300 BPM → halve (e.g. 280 → 140) to avoid double-tempo lock.
   - Reduces mismatches where Traktor shows 128 and we showed 64 (or vice versa).

**Note:** Traktor 3.4+ may ignore file BPM and re-analyze on import; in that case values can still differ. For best match: either analyze in Traktor first and then scan in RecoDeck (we use tag BPM), or run "Analyze BPM & Key" in RecoDeck and use the normalized value.

### 2026-02-12 — UI cleanup and auto file watching

**Header buttons cleanup (App.tsx):**
- Removed **Cleanup** button from header (duplicate cleanup still runs automatically on app startup)
- Removed **Analyze BPM** button from header (now available via right-click context menu)
- Removed **Refresh** button from header (replaced by automatic file watching)
- Removed unused `handleCleanupDuplicates` function
- Header now only has "Scan Folder" and Settings (⚙) buttons

**Right-click "Analyze All Tracks" (FolderTree.tsx):**
- Added `onAnalyzeAll` prop and `"all-tracks"` context menu type
- Right-clicking on "All Tracks" in sidebar shows "Analyze All Tracks" option
- Calls the same `handleAnalyzeAll` logic the old header button used
- Library folders still have "Analyze Tracks" (folder-scoped) on right-click

**Automatic file watching (replaces Refresh button):**
- **Backend** — New `watcher.rs` module using `notify` crate (already a dependency):
  - `start_file_watcher` Tauri command accepts library folder list
  - Watches all library folders recursively via `notify::RecommendedWatcher`
  - Filters to only audio file changes (mp3, flac, wav, ogg, m4a, aac, aiff)
  - Debounces events (2-second minimum between emits)
  - Emits `library-changed` Tauri event to frontend on create/modify/remove
  - `WatcherState` managed state holds the active watcher (prevents drop)
- **Frontend API** — Added `startFileWatcher(folders)` to tauri-api.ts
- **App.tsx integration:**
  - Starts watcher after initialization with all library folders
  - Listens for `library-changed` event via `@tauri-apps/api/event`
  - On change: re-scans all folders, cleans duplicates, reloads track list
  - Restarts watcher when folders change (via Settings or Scan Folder)
  - Uses refs for callbacks to avoid stale closures in event listener

### 2026-09-07 — M0 spike: YouTube embedded playback is not viable (yt-tracklist port)

**Context:** porting the `yt-tracklist` tool into RecoDeck. The original tool runs in a
browser, where an embedded YouTube player is trivial. Before building anything, M0 asked
one question: does that player work inside RecoDeck?

**Answer: no, and for two independent reasons. Do not retry this.**

**Wall 1 — the `tauri://localhost` origin.** A production build serves the frontend over a
custom scheme, not http. YouTube's player then fails with error 153 ("no valid Referer"),
because a custom-scheme page sends no Referer header. Measured against all six real DJ sets
in the tool's `fixtures/`: 6 of 6 failed. All four known workarounds failed too —
`host: youtube-nocookie`, `playerVars.origin`, `widget_referrer`, and a plain iframe with no
JS API. This is invisible in `tauri dev`, where the origin is `http://localhost:1420` and
everything appears to work.

This wall *is* breakable: serving the player page from the Axum companion server the app
already runs gives a real http origin, and one set then genuinely played inside RecoDeck.

**Wall 2 — the sets themselves refuse embedding.** Surveyed the same six sets from a plain
Chrome tab, outside the app entirely:

| set | result |
|---|---|
| Solomun @ Cercle (`QHDRRxKlimY`) | embeddable |
| Luciano @ Thuishaven (`X6WpzQoI0mc`) | error 150 |
| Dr Banana / Mixmag (`fjR4idz1-MA`) | error 150 |
| Priku B2B Traumer (`ucfEH7g9JWI`) | error 150 |
| Boris Brejcha @ Cercle (`vqz8c4ZP3Wg`) | error 150 |
| Hot Since 82 / Mixmag (`xJR7q0XN8oU`) | error 150 |

Five of six refuse embedded playback anywhere — Chrome gives the same verdict as our webview,
so this is not a Tauri problem and no origin change fixes it. Verified it is not an artifact
of the test harness: re-ran with a fresh document per video, and again with a single player
alone (no rapid-fire loads). Same result each time.

**Trap for later:** the YouTube Data API reports `status.embeddable: true` for all six. That
field does not predict playback and must not be used as a pre-check. The only reliable signal
is attempting playback and catching error 150/101.

**Decision:** listening happens by opening the set in the user's browser at the right
timestamp (`&t=1260s`) via `tauri-plugin-opener`, which is already a dependency. Consequence
for CSP: only `img-src` needs `https://i.ytimg.com` for thumbnails — no `frame-src`, no
`script-src`, which is also the safer outcome.

**Side finding:** thumbnails from `i.ytimg.com` load fine under CSP once `img-src` allows them.

### 2026-09-07 — M1: YouTube key, quota counter, and network layer (yt-tracklist port)

**Rust**
- `external/` finally declared in `lib.rs` — the directory had existed unused since the
  original scaffold and was never part of the crate
- `external/youtube.rs` — Data API v3 client. Fetching a set returns the exact shape the
  standalone tool writes into `fixtures/`, which is why these three structs are camelCase
  while the rest of the app's IPC is snake_case: the ported parser reads that shape verbatim
  and the fixtures are its tests
- `external/youtube_time.rs` — Pacific calendar helpers. Quota resets at midnight Pacific
  (about 09:00 local), so the quota bucket cannot key off the local date. Written by hand
  rather than adding a date crate (Rule 1), including the US daylight-saving rule
- `commands/youtube.rs` — key save/status/delete, 1-unit connection test, quota reading,
  and set fetching. Locks are never held across a network call (the Phase 28 rule)
- Google bills the attempt, so quota is recorded even when a call is rejected
- 20 new unit tests: quota day rollover against a real database, DST transitions, error
  mapping for `quotaExceeded` / `keyInvalid` / `accessNotConfigured`, ISO durations, and
  video-id extraction from every link shape. Suite is 135 passing, 0 clippy warnings from
  the new code

**Frontend**
- `types/youtube.ts`, IPC wrappers in `tauri-api.ts`, YouTube state in `SettingsContext`
- `YouTubeSection.tsx` in Settings: masked key field, Test Connection, a quota bar, and
  step-by-step instructions for creating a personal key

**Why each user brings their own key:** the 10,000 unit daily allowance is charged per key.
One key shipped inside the app would be one budget shared by everyone — a single search costs
100 units — and a key inside a binary is trivially extracted.

**Measured, not assumed:** a live fetch of `fjR4idz1-MA` cost 2 units (1 video + 1 comment
page) and produced 35 comments, 11 of them replies — identical to the fixture the standalone
tool wrote for the same video. Note that the quota spent during this check went through a
throwaway harness, not the app, so the in-app counter starts from zero.

**Gate passed 2026-09-07** — verified in the running app: saving a key, Test Connection moving
the quota by one unit, and a deliberately wrong key producing a readable sentence.

Two things the gate caught, both fixed:

- The failure was announced only by a toast in the corner while the section itself still said
  "✓ API key configured", which is exactly the moment a user needs to be told to try another
  key. The section now carries the result inline, and the saved-key line no longer claims the
  key is good until it has actually been tested.
- Underneath that: `getErrorMessage` in `types/ai.ts` maps backend errors to human sentences,
  but the new YouTube variants were missing from it. For unit variants carrying no message —
  `YtInvalidKey`, `YtQuotaExceeded`, `YtApiNotEnabled` — the raw object reached the UI instead
  of a sentence. Any future `AppError` variant has to be added there too.

## Next Steps

1. **NOW**: Continue Phase 2 — Next milestone: 2.1 Mel spectrogram or 2.4 Waveform peaks
2. Optional: Analysis queue UI with progress (2.18), spectrogram viz (2.16)
3. Optional: Write BPM to file tags after analysis (so other apps see our value)
